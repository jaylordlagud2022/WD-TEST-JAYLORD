Task:
"Integrate the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and display the current weather for a userâ€™s location on a custom WooCommerce product page. The page should show the weather along with a message suggesting a related product."

- Just create a shortcode for the function.

## Usage

To display the weather of a user and related products when product ID is supplied, use the following shortcode: [custom_weather_suggestion] or [custom_weather_suggestion product_id=123]
